            <h1> Description </h1>
            <p> 
                Kinect Adventures is the main launch game for Microsoft's Kinect peripheral as it comes packed in with the Kinect device, much like Wii Sports for the Nintendo Wii.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The game offers five main mini-game challenges, largely geared towards showing off the device with casual, family-oriented gameplay. It requires the peripheral to play with online gameplay and local games for up to two players, head-to-head or cooperatively. Online players can be friends or random players found online.
