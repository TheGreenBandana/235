                    Hello! I'm a 2nd year Game Design and Development student at Rochester Institute of Technology. This is a page I'm using for my intro web development class, welcome! I love games, and learning new languages and tools to make them. Tabletop Role-playing games have been another passion of mine for a long time. Unrelated to games, hike, canoe, and play the banjo. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the end of this class I hope to be competent enough to set up a personal website for use as a portfolio, and to help my parents with their website.
                    I hope to find an in-person job in game development, UI/UX design, software engineering, or web development by the end of my time at RIT.
                </p>
