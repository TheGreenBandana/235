        <h2>goal</h2>
        <p> I want this to be an informational page about the banjo for those who don't know anything about the instrument and aren't necessarily musicians.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
        <p>There are a ton of different tiny pieces of text on the original document that I didn't include in my build to spec. This is mostly because they're not going to be replaced with anything in the finished version, but also because including them would have made the html much more complicated. The reason that the images are both really large and pngs is because they are already blurry enough without added jpg compression, and because pngs will do the black and white coloring well. </p>
